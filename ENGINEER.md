## Introduction

**mvent** is a Python package enabling event-driven shared memory communication and advanced in-memory IPC patterns. With a simple, decorator-based API, it allows multi-process applications and distributed systems to communicate efficiently and react to real-time data changes, events, and message flows—all with strong thread safety, monitoring, and optional encryption.

**Key features:**
- Shared memory communication
- Event-driven, decorator-centric API
- TTL for temporary data
- In-memory HTTP, streaming, sockets, and pub/sub channels
- Monitoring and statistics hooks
- Optional encrypted shared memory (AES/Fernet)
- Thread-safe: locks, cleanup, resource management

## Usage Patterns & Workflows

Below are fundamental and advanced workflows distilled from real mvent examples. Each shows how to compose core and advanced modules for common engineering scenarios.

### 1. Basic Event-Driven Shared Memory (Multi-Handler Pattern)

```python
from mvent.decorators.memory_events import MemoryEventHandler
import time

# Create a memory event handler tied to shared memory
memory_events = MemoryEventHandler("example_pool")

# Handler for event
@memory_events.on("user_data")
def handle_user_update(new_value):
    print(f"Received user data update: {new_value}")

# Another handler for the SAME event
@memory_events.on("user_data")
def log_user_update(new_value):
    print(f"Logging user update: {new_value}")

try:
    print("Emitting events...")
    memory_events.emit("user_data", {"name": "John", "age": 30})
    time.sleep(1)
    memory_events.emit("user_data", {"name": "Jane", "age": 25})
    time.sleep(1)
    # Emit event with TTL—auto expires
    memory_events.emit("user_data", {"name": "Bob", "age": 35}, ttl=2.0)
    time.sleep(3)
finally:
    memory_events.cleanup()
```

**Pattern:** Multiple handlers per event, TTL for temporary data, event emission triggers all subscribers in all processes using that pool.

---

### 2. In-Memory HTTP Request/Response & Streaming

```python
from mvent.core.in_memory_http import InMemoryHTTPManager

http = InMemoryHTTPManager()

@http.route("/greet")
def greet_handler(request):
    data = request["data"]
    return {"greeting": f"Hello, {data['name']}!"}

# Regular request
resp = http.send_request("/greet", method="POST", data={"name": "Alice"})
print("HTTP Response:", resp)

# Route with streaming response using StreamingEvent
@http.route("/stream")
def stream_handler(request, stream_event=None):
    for i in range(3):
        stream_event.publish(f"Chunk {i}")
    return stream_event

stream = http.send_request("/stream", stream=True)
def stream_receiver(msg): print("STREAM CHUNK:", msg)
stream.subscribe(stream_receiver)
import time
time.sleep(1)
stream.stop()
```

---

## Benchmarking

mvent provides real-world benchmark scripts to directly compare its in-memory IPC performance against traditional Python HTTP (http.server + requests), FastAPI, and low-level sockets.

### 1. HTTP Benchmark (InMemoryHTTPManager vs FastAPI vs http.server)

Location: [`benchmarking/benchmark_http_vs_mvent.py`](benchmarking/benchmark_http_vs_mvent.py:1)
- **What it tests:** Throughput, latency (avg/p95), CPU usage, memory usage, and overall resource efficiency across common Python web IPC methods.
- **How it works:** Each server type (http.server, FastAPI, mvent InMemoryHTTPManager) is run, requests are sent in bulk, and a local ResourceMonitor thread samples CPU/memory at 10ms intervals.
- **Metrics collected:** 
  - Req/s (throughput), latency (ms), p95 latency, CPU %, memory usage, delta, and an "efficiency score" (req/s per CPU%)
- **How to run:** Run the script, select which benchmark (quick, standard, or stress test), and review terminal plus [`HTTP_BENCHMARKS.txt`](HTTP_BENCHMARKS.txt:1) for detailed summary.

**Sample output:**
- Each method's throughput, mean/p95 latency, CPU & RAM, and calculated "efficiency"
- Performance insights: speedup, CPU savings, etc. (e.g., "mvent is 3.5x faster than traditional HTTP, saves 25% CPU usage")

## Installation, Migration & Compatibility

### Installation

To install mvent:

```bash
pip install mvent
```

For optional encryption support (Fernet/AES):

```bash
pip install cryptography
```

### Migration and Compatibility

- **Legacy Support:**  
  All new APIs are opt-in. Existing mvent codebases (using memory events, basic pools) are forward-compatible—new modules (HTTP, streaming, sockets, monitoring, encryption) do not interfere with old code.
- **Enabling Security:**  
  To enable encryption for a shared memory pool, create it with an `encryption_key`:
  ```python
  from mvent.core.shared_memory import SharedMemoryPool
  from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
  key = Fernet.generate_key()
  secure_pool = SharedMemoryPool("secure_pool", encryption_key=key)
  ```
- **Monitoring:**  
  Attach a MonitoringTools instance to any manager to record stats and event handler performance.

### Compatibility Notes

- **Thread Safety:**

## Engineering Notes & Edge Cases

### Limitations & Gotchas

- **TTL Expiry Consistency:**  
  TTL cleanup runs in background threads. Small delays (subsecond) may occur before expired data is cleared.
- **Multiprocess Event Delivery:**  
  All processes using the same pool receive events, but handler execution is only guaranteed in responsive/running processes. Stopped or blocked processes may miss triggers.
- **Encryption Overhead:**  
  Using Fernet/AES introduces slight overhead for set/get ops (worthwhile for sensitive data only).  
- **StreamingEvent Chunks:**  
  If a stream subscriber falls behind (slow callback), chunk delivery may create memory pressure.
- **Debugging Interprocess Issues:**  
  Use MonitoringTools to attach metrics to every pool/event/handler for visibility.

### Extensibility Notes

- **Adding new IPC patterns:**  
  Derive new managers from SharedMemoryPool/EventManager for custom protocols.
- **Extending Monitoring:**  
  Implement callback wrappers and stats storage in MonitoringTools for new analytics.
- **Custom Storage Backends:**  
  Swap out mmap for alternate shared memory or fully distributed stores—update only internal pool logic.

### System-Specific

- **Windows:**  
  Memory-mapped files stored in local user temp directories; cleanup guaranteed by OS at reboot.
- **Linux/macOS:**  
  Uses `/tmp`; user and group permissions may require adjustment.

## Review

This documentation provides every engineering detail of mvent: from core design and API to benchmarks, diagrams, usage, extensibility, limitations, and practical engineering tips.

Use [`ENGINEER.md`](ENGINEER.md:1) as the canonical resource for maintenance, extension, and onboarding of new contributors and advanced users.

---
  All public APIs are thread-safe. Locks safeguard every mutation and cleanup operation.
- **Python Version:**  
  Target: Python 3.8+, due to typing/contextlib and multiprocessing support.
- **Platform:**  
  Works cross-platform (Linux, Windows, macOS). For best performance, run benchmarks on native hardware, not VMs.
- **Resources:**  
  Monitors CPU and RAM usage internally; pool memory is bounded only by OS disk/quota and cleanup TTL.

### Data/Event Sequence

Sample event flow: "Event emitted in Process A triggers callback in Process B"

1. Process_A uses `MemoryEventHandler.emit`
2. Data written to SharedMemoryPool
3. EventManager detects change in pool value
4. All subscribed handlers in all processes are triggered (via `on("event")`)
5. Handler execution in respective processes

> Extend these diagrams for custom architecture or edge cases as needed (e.g., multi-stream, multi-room messaging, encrypted pools).

### 2. Sockets Benchmark (SocketsManager vs traditional Python sockets)

Location: [`benchmarking/benchmark_sockets_vs_mvent.py`](benchmarking/benchmark_sockets_vs_mvent.py:1)
- **What it tests:** Pub/sub, send/recv reliability, and raw throughput for both mvent and traditional TCP sockets.
- **How it works:** Traditional sockets use a server/client on a local port; mvent SocketsManager implements the same pub/sub pattern in RAM. Delivery timing and reliability are checked for 1-way tests.
- **Metrics collected:** Time to deliver N messages over both mechanisms, end-to-end.
- **How to run:** Run the script. It prints time for each backend and verifies correct message count.

**Best Practices:**
- Use "Standard" or "Stress Test" for realistic performance data.
- Always run on a quiescent (unloaded) machine for accurate stats.
- Inspect resource and efficiency metrics—not just raw req/s—to choose the best IPC backend for your app.
- Use benchmarks as templates for extending your own IPC patterns.

---
**Pattern:** Registered handlers for HTTP-like endpoints—supports both one-shot and streaming outputs (fully in RAM).

---

### 3. In-Memory Sockets: Room-Based Pub/Sub

```python
from mvent.core.sockets_manager import SocketsManager

sockets = SocketsManager()

def chat_handler(msg):
    print("ROOM GOT:", msg)

room = "general"
sockets.connect(room)
sockets.subscribe(room, chat_handler)
sockets.send(room, "Hello, room!")
sockets.send(room, "mvent sockets, in RAM only.")

import time
time.sleep(1)
sockets.disconnect(room)
```

**Pattern:** Room/channel abstraction for socket-like, multi-producer/multi-consumer pub/sub on shared memory; integrates with other mvent modules.

---

### 4. Real-Time Streaming: Observables over Shared Memory

```python
from mvent.core.streaming_event import StreamingEvent

stream = StreamingEvent(stream_key="chatroom1")

def receiver(data):
    print("STREAMED MESSAGE:", data)

stream.subscribe(receiver)

# Simulate publishing several messages ("chunks")
for i in range(5):
    stream.publish(f"Live chunk {i}")

import time
time.sleep(1)
stream.stop()
```

**Pattern:** Data published to a stream is delivered live to all subscribers; excellent for observables and chunked data feeds.

---

### 5. Monitoring and Encrypted Pools

```python
from mvent.core.monitoring import MonitoringTools
from mvent.core.shared_memory import SharedMemoryPool
try:
    from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
except ImportError:
    Fernet = None

if Fernet:
    key = Fernet.generate_key()
    secure_pool = SharedMemoryPool("secure_demo_pool", encryption_key=key)
else:
    print("Encryption demo: cryptography package not installed.")
    secure_pool = SharedMemoryPool("plain_demo_pool")

monitor = MonitoringTools(pool=secure_pool)

def handler(x): return x * x
wrapped_handler = monitor.wrap_handler("square", handler)
monitor.record_event("square_call")

res = wrapped_handler(5)
print("Handler result:", res)
print("Event stats:", monitor.get_event_stats())
print("Handler stats:", monitor.get_handler_stats())
print("Memory stats:", monitor.get_memory_stats())
```

**Pattern:** Drop-in monitoring for any handler/event, live pool stats, and opt-in end-to-end encryption.
